## Overview:
Feature-Imitating-Networks (FINs) are specialized neural networks that first learn to replicate specific closed-form statistical features, such as Entropy. These networks are then incorporated into larger neural network architectures to potentially enhance their functionality. Our study marks the inaugural evaluation of FINs within the context of biomedical image processing. These findings suggest that FINs could significantly improve the state-of-the-art in various other biomedical image processing tasks. This opens up new pathways for research and practical applications in medical imaging fields.
